# Graph LMS Key Components 

Here are the key components of a Learning Management System (LMS). For each system, we list the core data entities that they manage. What is the relationship between these entities?

## Overview

A Learning Management System (LMS) is a software application designed for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation, and delivery of educational courses, training programs, or learning and development programs. The key components and core data entities of an LMS, along with their relationships, include:

## User Management**

    -   **Entities**: Students, Instructors, Administrators.
    -   **Relationship**: Administrators manage the access and roles of Instructors and Students. Instructors and Students interact within courses.
## Content Management

    -   **Entities**: Courses, Modules, Lessons, Assessments.
    -   **Relationship**: Courses are divided into Modules, which are further broken down into Lessons. Assessments are linked to Lessons and Modules to evaluate the understanding of Students.

5. Students are enrolled in Course Offerings
6. A Student's progress through Courses, Modules, and Lessons is tracked in Enrollment Records.

## Assessment and Testing

### Entities

1. Quizzes
2. Tests
3. Assignments
4. Grades

### Relationships

### Assessments

### Relationships

These tools facilitate communication between Students and Instructors, and among Students themselves. They are often integrated within Courses or available as general features of the LMS.

## Reporting and Analytics

### Entities

1. Student Transcript
2. Student Record
3. Student Progress Reports
4. Analytics Dashboards (Courses, Departments, Student)

### Relationship

Data from User Management, Course Progress, and Assessment Results are aggregated and analyzed to produce Reports and Analytics, useful for Administrators and Instructors for decision-making and improvement of the learning process.

## Certification and Compliance Tracking

### Entities

1. Certificates of Completion
2. Compliance Records

### Relationships

Upon successful completion of Courses or specific compliance training, Students may receive Certificates. Compliance Records track whether mandatory training has been completed.

## E-commerce Integration

## Integration with External Systems

### Entities

1. Data Exchange with HR systems
2. Content Libraries
3. Third-party Tools

### Relationships

The LMS may need to exchange data with external Human Resources systems for employee training, integrate with external content libraries for additional resources, or work with third-party tools for specific functionalities (like advanced analytics).

## Resource Library

### Entities

Digital Resources (eBooks, Videos, Articles).

### Relationships
These resources are linked to specific Courses or Modules and are accessible to Students for enhanced learning.

In summary, the LMS functions as an ecosystem where these entities interact to deliver a comprehensive learning experience. The system manages the relationships between users, content, assessments, communications, and reporting to facilitate effective learning and training processes.
