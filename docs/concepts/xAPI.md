# The IEEE xAPI Standard for Student Tracking in LMS Systems 

xAPI (Experience API), also known as Tin Can API, is a learning technology standard that allows for comprehensive tracking of learning experiences across multiple platforms and environments, extending beyond traditional LMS boundaries.

## What is xAPI?

xAPI is an advanced learning technology standard that enables the collection and exchange of learning data from various sources, beyond the traditional LMS environment. It was developed as a significant improvement over the older SCORM standard.

## How xAPI Works

The xAPI defines learning activities as statements. These contain a subject, object, and verb. When an employee does a defined action in an organization's learning portal that enables the xAPI, which validates the xAPI learning experience.

When learners complete an activity with xAPI enabled, they send a statement to a learning record store (LRS). The LRS receives, stores, and accesses learning records (also called activity statements) across many different platforms (including mobile apps).

## Key Benefits of xAPI

1. **Comprehensive Tracking**: A xAPI enabled LMS not only provides an organization with insight into what goes inside a Learning Management System, but it can also track employee activity and record valuable data regarding an employee's performance.

2. **Beyond Formal Learning**: Formal learning experiences account for only about 10% of the ways students actually learn. The remainder occurs through interactions with mentors and peers (about 20%) and experiential learning (about 70%). xAPI allows businesses to track as much as 100% of learning experiences.

3. **Learning Analytics**: xAPI allows for deeper tracking of learning. This application is able to track the information learners seek whether that be through the elearning content provided by a company or outside information on the internet.

4. **Mobile and Offline Learning**: Unlike SCORM, which requires an LMS, xAPI enables tracking outside traditional eLearning courses, including real-world experiences.

## Relationship with SCORM

xAPI is backward-compatible with SCORM (SCORM-compliant content can be used with an xAPI learning management system), so xAPI is often viewed as the new de facto standard. However, it significantly expands tracking capabilities beyond what SCORM could do.
