# About the Graph Learning Management System Project

This project was created by [Dan McCreary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danmccreary/)
to promote the use of AI and knowledge graph technologies in
education.  Dan felt that current LMS systems built
on traditional relational databases did not meet the
needs of an AI driven LMS that can generate real-time [hyper-personalized](glossary.md#hyper-personalization) interactive [MicroSims](./glossary.md#microsim)
during the learning process.

## Mission

We promote the use of emerging technologies to aid human learning.  We focus
on how to represent knowledge that can be used to create real-time hyper-personalize
learning experiences for everyone.

## Values

1. The right to education is a fundamental human right.
2. We need to find ways to promote free education around the world.
3. We leverage the most advanced AL and ML-based technologies.
4. We believe that antiquated forms of knowledge representation are the key
factor in holding back most legacy LMS systems.
5. We believe that knowledge graphs are fundamental to building personalized recommendations.
6. We believe that technology can be used to build advanced AI tutors while
maintaining student privacy.

In order to keep this website to a reasonable size, we have partitioned related
knowledge into several other [microsites]() that each have their own search.
