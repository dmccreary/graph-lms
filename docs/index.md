# Graph Learning Management Systems

Welcome to the Graph Learning Management Systems (GLMS) website.

Our mission is to build open-source tools that promote the
hyper-personalization of learning built upon scale-out knowledge
graph technologies.

We believe that every human being has the right to free access to
systems that use AI and machine learning to help them achieve their
learning objectives.  We feel that graph-based machine learning is
the best way to do this.
