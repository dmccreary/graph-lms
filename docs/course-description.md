# Graph Learning Management Systems Course Description

**Title:** Graph Learning Management Systems
**Audience:** College students, educators or business professionals curious about using graph database to model and manage advanced AI-based learning management systems that are not constrained by legacy systems
**Grade Level:** College Juniors or Above

## Course Overview

Most Learning Management Systems in use today are not capable of meeting the increasing demands of of AI-driven students, teachers and administrators. Most legacy LMS systems were built around the notion that the primary goal of an LMS was to track courses, enrollment and grading.  Their reporting focus was [counts and amounts](glossary.md#counts-and-amounts) not recommending learning paths.  However, modern graph databases are much more capable at providing a platform that will create a detailed model of the world that enable real-time content recommendation to support every students learning goals.

This course provides a foundation of concepts learners need to know to understand why modern LMS systems must be based on a real-time graph database.  We introduce many of the challenges of integrating [intelligent textbooks](./glossary.md)
