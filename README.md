## About

Graph LMS is a comprehensive documentation project exploring Learning Management Systems through graph-based architectures. This site covers concepts, architectures, and implementations for modern educational technology systems that leverage graph databases and network relationships to enhance learning experiences.

### Key Topics

- **Concept Graphs**: Mapping knowledge relationships and prerequisites
- **Content Graphs**: Structuring educational materials and resources  
- **Learning Trajectories**: Personalized pathways through educational content
- **Experience API (xAPI)**: Standardized learning activity tracking
- **Learning Record Store (LRS)**: Data storage and analytics
- **Graph-based Integrated Learning Architecture (ILA)**: Modern educational system design

## Development

This site is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Conda (recommended) or pip

### Setup

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n mkdocs python=3
conda activate mkdocs

# Install dependencies
pip install mkdocs "mkdocs-material[imaging]"
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# Build documentation
mkdocs build

# Serve locally at http://localhost:8000
mkdocs serve

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

## 🎯 Mission

<<<<<<< HEAD
We promote the use of emerging technologies to aid human learning, focusing on how to represent knowledge that can be used to create real-time hyper-personalized learning experiences for everyone.

## ✨ Features

- **Graph-Based Data Models**: Comprehensive JSON models representing LMS entities and relationships
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Web-based simulations demonstrating learning graph concepts
- **Architecture Documentation**: Detailed system design for graph-based LMS implementations
- **Concept Frameworks**: Learning trajectories, content graphs, and xAPI integration guides
- **Development Tools**: Python scripts for graph analysis and visualization
